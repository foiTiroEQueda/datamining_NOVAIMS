##Birth Year/Age
df['Age'] = 2016 - df['BirthYear']
df['Age'].describe()
#min: 15, max: 988

#Keep age, discard birth year
#Look for outliers, define thresholds, under 18 should not be considered valid


##Create "years as customer" to replace FirstPYear

##Education

#Convert to numerical scale

##Children
df['Children'].drop_duplicates()
df['Children'].isna().sum()
#21 of the 10296 are NaN (0.2%)
df.loc[df['Children']==0, 'Children'].count()
#3013 of the 10296 don't have children
df.loc[df['Children']==1, 'Children'].count()
#7262 of the 10296 have children


##Premiums
df['Motor Premium'].describe()
df['Household Premium'].describe()
df['Health Premium'].describe()
df['Life Premium'].describe()
df['Work Premium'].describe()
#it is difficult to analyze without proper business background




##First Premium Year
df['FirstPYear'].describe()
df['FirstPYear'].drop_duplicates()
#it is possible to identify some errors, namely an impossibly high value and NaN

##MonthSalary
df['MonthSalary'].describe()
#Not enough to identify potential errors

df.loc[df['MonthSalary']<618.33]


##LivingArea
df['LivingArea'].drop_duplicates()
#Missing values present

##CustMonVal
#(annual profit from the customer) X (number of years that they are a customer) - (acquisition cost) 
df['CustMonVal'].describe()
df.loc[pd.isnull(df['CustMonVal'])]
#outliers here are difficult to classify as errors, due to the nature of this variable. A further analysis is needed

##ClaimsRate
#Amount paid by the insurance company (€)/ Premiums (€)  
#Note: in the last 2 years Motor 
df['ClaimsRate'].describe()
df.loc[pd.isnull(df['ClaimsRate'])]
#As in CustMonVal, it is difficult to classify outliers as errors, further analysis is needed

##Checking if there are missing ids
np.isnan(df['CID']).drop_duplicates()
#no missing ids

##Checking if there are duplicated ids
df[df.duplicated(['CID'])]
#no duplicated ids


##By this basic analysis, it is possible to:
#- Exclude the variable "BirthYear", given the new variable "Age" is enough
#- Understand that "Educ" should be transformed to a numerical variable, containing only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
#- A strategy should be defined for "Children", in order to deal with missing values, enabling the transformation to a Boolean variable
#- There should be further analysis to the Premium variables. This should not be aggregated into only one variable for every scenario,
#(...) as information about different insurance policy types is essential for some clustering scenarios
#- It is necessary to clean, perform coherence verification and further analyze "FirtPYear", "MonthSalary", CustMonVal" and "ClaimsRate"
#- Variables with possible discrepancies identified: Age, FirstPYear







#***
#***1.1.4 Coherence/discrepancy verification***
#***
#Strategy changed. Missing values treatment was first, but in the process it was discovered
#that, to use some missing values treatment techniques, data should already be somewhat free
#of inconsistencies. Basically, missing values treatment can be affected by coherence verification
#while the latter is not affected by the first


##MonthSalary
#Salaries below the minimum wage are possible, and without context, it is impossible to know (...)
#(...) if this value is a salary (particular customer) or profit (company customer).
#Nevertheless, it is important to analyze each of these cases, in order to determine if those customers (...)
#(...) can be considered in risk for not being able to pay the premiums.

#- All have insurance policies in each category (including motor, household and work compensation)
#(- and all have age <18)

#The data suggests that these are customers, but:
#- <18 don't have insurance
#- Not expected that <18 have children, salary, car and house

#This and the analysis from FirstPYear before BirthYear may suggest that the variable age is not to be trusted
#Although variables originated from user imput are less trustable that variables derived from system generated values,(...)
#(...) age is considerably important in the insurance context, given that age is considered not only in the calculation of (...)
#(...) insurance premiums but also in the decision of granting insurance to the customer.
#Nevertheless, tt is not possible, without more data and deeper context from the business, to clearly point out (...)
#that the problem is totally due to the variable age, given that FirstPYear also has discrepancies (missing values (...)
#(...) and non-date/impossible date values), which denotes the existence of errors in this variable, further (...)

#(...) to provide a complete analysis.
#Despite being a highly important dimension of the analysis, it is not possible to trust in the age (...)
#(...) variable, since there is not enough information to confirm that other age/birthdate values (...)
#(...) are not incorrect too.

#NOT GOING TO BE DONE, BUT MENTION IN REPORT

#(...) company could play a different role of the claims rate in the analysis.
#Then, given that this rate is for two years, it is possible to obtain the value paid by (...)
#(...) the insurance company in the last two years.
#(Given that ClaimsRate is for every type of policy)
#---> Refer claims rate for every type of policy, subsequent analysis and indmenization analysis

##Negative Premium Values
#There are two possible approaches to deal with negative premium values. Since we are dealing with (...)
#(...) aggregated values for premiums, there are several possible scenarios:
#- The value presented in a policy category is the sum of every premium paid by the insured (positive or 0)
#- The value presented in a policy category is the sum of every premium paid by the insured - value return due to cancelation of one policy (total value is still positive, sum of premiums paid > money given back)
#- The value presented in a policy category is the sum of every premium paid by the insured - value return due to cancelation of one policy (total value is negative, sum of premiums paid < money given back)
#- The value presented in a policy category is the sum of every premium paid by the insured - value return due to cancelation of one policy (total value is 0, sum of premiums paid = money given back)
#- The value presented in a policy category is the sum of money given back to the ensured (negative)
#Since we have no information about premium values isolated from money returned to the ensured, several issues arise, (...)
#(...) given that we may be considering for clustering customers with the same values for premiums that are in fact very different.

#A strategy to reduce this issues could be to transform negative premium values to 0, which would increase the clustering accuracy by (...)
#(...) removing the weight of value returned and considering only premium values. On the other hand, this strategy cannot be implemented, (...)
#(...) given that other returns could still be in the data, and that partial removal could bring more disadvantages than advantages.

#--> Negative premium values will be kept


##Creation of branches
#For clustering, it can be useful to perform two approaches, giving two different views:
#- Absolute values (clustering will occur based on absolute values) => df
#- Ratios and percentages (clustering will occur based on amount spent in a specific category in comparison with other categories) => df2

#------------------------------------------------------------------
#It would be useful to create the said branches, but that would imply a different strategy to deal with (...)
#(...) negative premium values, given that negative premium values will produce inaccurate ratios and totals.
#This strategy would only be possible, with the desired accuracy, if premium values and returned values to the insured would be separated.
